New Zealand's Adam Hall and Corey Peters finish run at 2013 IPC Alpine World Championships
Friday March 1, 2013
With the IPC Alpine World Championships officially ending Wednesday with the conclusion of the national team non-medal friendly competition a day after the competition's official closing ceremony, New Zealand's Adam Hall and Corey Peters have completed their run. Their country did not compete in the team competition as they did not have enough skiers to form a team.
With their first event the second race of the competition, Hall finished ninth in the men's standing Super-G with a time of 1:16.65, 4.16 seconds off the winning time set by Austrian Markus Salcher. Peters finished the Super-G with a time of 1:18.95 in the men's sitting group for a 22 place finish in a field of 25 skiers.
Hall had his best finish at the Championships on the third day of competition when he earned a bronze medal in the Slalom. Peters did not fair as well, earning a Did Not Finish (DNF) during his second run in the Slalom and consequently not ranking.
In the Super Combined, Hall finished ninth with a combined run time of 1:49.87, 7.43 seconds slower than first place finisher Austrian Matthias Lanzinger. Peters's problems continued, as he earned a DNF during his first run.
Peters finished tenth in the Giant Slalom, with a combined run time of 2:37.73, 21.93 seconds slower than Japanese gold medalist Taiki Morri. Hall skipped the event.
Despite New Zealand's small size, the country has a history of doing well at the Winter Paralympics. Most recently, the country saw success when Hall won a gold medal in the men's standing event at the 2010 Winter Paralympics in Vancouver.

Austria regains medal leadboard after fourth competition day of 2013 IPC Alpine World Championships
Tuesday, February 26, 2013
Yesterday, following the Super Combined event at the 2013 IPC Alpine World Championships, Austria took the lead again in the medal count having earned six total gold medals across four days of competition. France is tied with Austria in the overall medal count.
Austria's medal tally yesterday included a gold by LW11 classified Claudia Loesch in the women's sitting event, a gold by LW4 classified Matthias Lanzinger in the men's standing event, and a bronze by LW11 classified Philipp Bonadimann in the men's sitting event.
Following her gold medal winning, Loesch told the media she was super happy she won, and she had a really good slalom run. She went on to say she usually finishes in second and this was a surprise for her.
France's medal count increased with a gold by LW6/8-2 Marie Bochet in the women's standing, and a bronze by LW4 classified Cedric Amafroi-Broisat in the men's standing.
Spain's vision impaired skier Jon Santacana, who won Spain's only two medals in the competition, failed to finish his second run in the Super Combined. Following the race, he was visibly upset. He had finished the first run in first place by a tenth of a second ahead of eventual gold medalist Chris Williamson and guide Robin Femy of Canada. Williamson hugged silver medalist Miroslav Haraus of Slovakia, and Santacana when Santacana and guide Miguel Galindo Garces returned to the finishing area after Santacana's fall. Spain's other entrant in the men's visually impaired Super Combined event, Gabriel Gorce and guide Arnau Ferrer, finished three thousandths of a second out of medal contention with a combined run time of 1:47.93.

At the finish of each competitor's second run, most are requested to go to doping control to insure they are not taking any banned substance. The 2013 IPC Alpine World Championships are scheduled to continue today.

Venezuela opens granite processing facility in Bolivar
Monday, February 18, 2013
Venezuela's government has opened a granite processing plant in the state of Bolivar, with the intention of providing about 25% of the granite required nationwide.
Ricardo Menendez, vice president of the Productive Economic Area, said Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has yearned for the creation of this project to empower Venezuelan construction. Granito Bolivar is reportedly the most modern Venezuelan granite plant, not consuming community water or electricity, and is also the largest, with a daily capacity to supply enough material for use in construction of about 820 houses.
Menendez said, "These granite blocks are the natural resources of our country, are the wealth we have as a country and often [some] simply decided to remove this richness from our country and take them to other countries"((es)).
According to Menendez, with the help of a state plan, Venezuela intends to exploit its 40,000 million cubic meters or more of granite reserves, generating a set of factories. "[T]he central theme is that these plants, all these factories, are for the construction of socialism; that means using our potential, develop the value chain within the country and of course that yields benefits from the point of view of the production system's organization.... [Granito] Bolivar is not only the vision that historically we had of exposing richness, but the industries, basic industries we have, that level of our workers in the basic industries and in addition the development of the potential we have in the state"((es)).
For the construction of the plant, supplied by 23 quarries, the government of Bolivar provided about 30 million bolivares (US$4.7 million) and the national government 802.3 million (US$3 million). Bolivar reportedly has reserves of about 40,000 million tons of red, black, pink and white granite, sufficient for domestic demand for 200 years.

United States economy shrinks by 0.1% in last quarter of 2012
Friday, February 1, 2013
The United States economy shrank by 0.1% in the last three months of 2012 according to official statistics released on Wednesday by the United States Department of Commerce. The contraction in the economy comes after growth of 3.1% in the previous quarter (July to September) and is the first contraction since the 2009 recession.
Economic growth is thought to have fallen due to cuts in government spending, including a 22% cut in the defence budget being the largest decline in defence spending since 1972. Economic analysts had expected a 1.1% in growth according to polling conducted by the news agency Reuters and that none of them had predicted a contraction in the economy.
Export levels were at their lowest for almost four years, this may be due to the recession in Europe and a decline in growth in China. However, there were increases in consumer spending and investments which shows that there may be other problems with the economy and that the "fiscal cliff" issues of December did not worry markets too much.

Australian Manns Mitre 10 hardware store closes after rent dispute
Sunday, January 27, 2013
Wednesday, an over-90-year-old Manns Mitre 10 hardware store, run by Alex P Mann Pty Ltd, closed until further notice after a rent dispute in Port Adelaide, South Australia. The rent dispute involved $315,060.70 of rent for months of September 2012 to January 2013 unpaid to the landlord, Fourteen Sails Pty Ltd. The site was distrained. The store had to fire about 40-50 employees without a warning in advance.
The store was closed three days before Australia Day, January 26, Saturday.
The store administrator, Tim Clifton, said they had to ring the workers out of the blue: "I was advised the landlord had distrained for unpaid rent over the business and that left the directors in the position where the business was untenable. I presume at this stage trading was poor and the company just didn't have the money to pay the rent. ... Unfortunately they had to terminate their employment this morning and we've rung them all. We'll do our best to get them their entitlements under the government schemes, and we calculate what they're owed in the next few days and hopefully get that underway for them. ... It's a sad day. It's a sign of the times isn't it. Things are tough out there."
Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union state secretary Dave Kirner said workers were not allowed to collect their personal belongings left inside of the store: "I spoke with a worker who said the locks have been changed, they were asked to leave and all their personal belongings are in there".
On Saturday, Wikinews took photos of the documents available at the store entrance. The rent dispute details and an inventory were available for everyone to read. During the ten minutes of taking photos, around seven people visited the closed entrance and read the documents a first time. One of them commented, "oh hey, Bunnings will be stronger".
The store owner, Jarred Spearman, reported negotiations ongoing with the landlord and said he would "hopefully try to work [our] way out of this ... We are pretty lucky to have the customers and staff we had".
Port Adelaide Mayor Gary Johanson said the loss of the store is a significant loss as Port Adelaide is being redeveloped: "Their staff were extremely good, the service levels were high, the store was always well stocked and it was a great example of a family business. That will be a great loss to the Port." "The landlord is not at fault here. The landlord is acting within their rights. ... This is the sort of thing we cannot afford to lose if we're serious about the Port being redeveloped. This is not a multinational company. This is a franchise of a bigger company but it is a family franchise and it employs a lot of staff. The staff that they employ are local people and they're employing large amounts of staff in relation to their turnover. We need to take stock of what local businesses we have left and say, how can we ensure they stay with us?"

British 4G mobile spectrum auction underway
Friday, January 25, 2013
The auction for the mobile spectrum capable of carrying 4G mobile broadband services in the United Kingdom got underway on Thursday. The auction process is expected to take several weeks and will take place online. Mobile network operators are expected to roll out services by July.
4G mobile network technology will bring faster downstream speeds than the current 3G connections allowing for data-intensive surfing on the move such as video streaming. Some mobile users have criticised the industry regulator Ofcom for having taken a long time to start rolling out the 4G technology, with the United Kingdom falling behind many other European countries.
EE (Everything Everywhere) launched the UK's first 4G network in a number of cities last year, however many people complained due to them being the only service provider. The bidders include the current main UK mobile network operators '97 Vodafone UK, Telefonica UK (O2), Everything Everywhere and Hutchinson 3G (3) '97 as well as British Telecommunications.
Ed Richards, the Chief Executive of Ofcom, said of the auction: "It will release the essential raw material for the next wave of mobile digital services. This will change the way we consume digital media in both our personal and working lives and deliver significant benefits to millions of consumers and businesses across the country."
Each bidder is competing with one another to win combinations of the 28 spectrum lots available from the 800MHz and 2.6GHz spectrum bands.

UK economy shrinks by 0.3% in fourth quarter of 2012
Friday, January 25, 2013
The United Kingdom economy shrank by 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2012 according to figures released today by the Office for National Statistics, increasing the likelihood of a triple-dip recession. This comes after the 0.9% growth seen in the preceding quarter which is believed to have been due to the Olympic Games. The Office for National Statistics has said economic output remained flat throughout 2012.
The British economy would have to contract in this quarter in order for there to be a recession, but hopes of positive figures are fading after a snow-hit Britain to the beginning of 2013 with figures suggesting a 3500m a day being lost in output.
Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said, "We can either run away from those problems or we can confront them. And I'm determined to confront them so we can go on creating jobs for the people of this country".
The construction sector rose by 0.3%, however, the production in the industrial and manufacturing sector fell by 1.8% and 1.5% respectively.
